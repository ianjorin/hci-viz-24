A [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field) visualization of simulated winds over northwestern Europe, based on Jo Wood's [LitVis wind vector example](https://github.com/gicentre/litvis/blob/master/examples/windVectors.md). This example uses the `angle` channel of the `symbol` mark to set the orientation of `wedge` or `arrow` shape types. Can you make out the shores of Great Britain, France, and Scandinavia based on the wind patterns alone?
